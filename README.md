# PromptEngineering

A battle-tested collection of prompt recipes to power Cursor, Windsurf, Codex and other AI coding agents.

Most AI tools jump straight to code but skip the engineering. They don’t ask what kind of project you’re building, ignore stack and config details, skip architecture planning, and never apply security models like STRIDE. That’s why this rule-based blueprint forces requirement clarification, solution analysis, project classification, and secure code generation. It works for both greenfield and legacy systems and turns AI from a reckless code printer into a real engineering partner.
